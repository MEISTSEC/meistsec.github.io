      <description>10/30/2022:
I love participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) events. When I first became focused on pursuing a career in cybersecurity, I was encouraged by many in the community to compete in the numerous CTFs that are available for all skill levels. What I enjoy most about them, as opposed to standard IT/Security courses, is that the CTF revolves around critical thinking and researching solutions to each challenge. There is no curriculum to reference; itâ€™s all on you!</description>
